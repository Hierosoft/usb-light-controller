To adapt your Arduino UNO R3 code, originally designed for a 5V RGB LED module, to control the MakerBot Replicator 2X’s 4-wire LED system (red, green, blue, and white wires), we need to address the hardware differences while preserving the code’s functionality, including PWM dimming. You’ve confirmed through testing that the white wire is the common negative (ground), and each color wire (red, green, blue) requires +24V, indicating a common-cathode RGB LED configuration powered by the printer’s 24V supply. Since you’ve replaced the original MightyBoard with a BTT SKR 1.4 Turbo and are now using an Arduino UNO R3 (5V logic) for manual LED control, we must design a circuit to bridge the 5V PWM signals to the 24V LED system. You’ve provided 24V relay modules as an option, but also asked about alternatives for PWM support, so we’ll explore both approaches, focusing on your 830-point breadboard setup and the components available.

### Understanding the MakerBot Replicator 2X LED System

The MakerBot Replicator 2X’s 4-wire female Dupont connector (red, green, blue, white) connects to its LED system, likely a status or illumination RGB LED. Your testing confirms:

- **White wire**: Common cathode (ground).
- **Red, green, blue wires**: Anodes for each color, each expecting +24V when active.

Since the original MightyBoard (based on an ATmega1280, a 5V microcontroller) controlled these LEDs with a 24V supply, it likely used intermediate circuitry (e.g., transistors or MOSFETs) to switch the 24V based on 5V signals, possibly with PWM for dimming. The LEDs are designed to operate at 24V, and any current-limiting resistors are either built into the LED assembly or were part of the MightyBoard’s circuitry. For simplicity, we’ll assume the LEDs are rated for 24V with appropriate current limiting in place, drawing typical indicator LED currents (e.g., 20-100mA per color).

The Arduino UNO R3 outputs 5V PWM signals on pins 9 (red), 10 (green), and 11 (blue), as defined in your code. The updateLED() function uses analogWrite() to set brightness levels (0-255, scaled by ledMaxLevel = 128), implying the original intent was PWM dimming. We need a circuit that:

1. Switches 24V to each anode using the Arduino’s 5V PWM signals.
2. Supports the code’s dimming functionality if the MakerBot LEDs are PWM-compatible.
3. Fits on your 830-point breadboard with the provided jumper wires and a 24V power supply (male Dupont connector).

### Option 1: Using the 24V Relay Modules

You’ve provided “24V 1 Channel Relay Modules with Opto-Isolation” for each color. Let’s assess their suitability:

#### Relay Module Specifications

- **Power Supply**: Supports 24V (VCC and GND pins).
- **Trigger**: 5mA at 5V (IN pin), configurable for high or low trigger via jumper.
- **Output**: NO (normally open), COM (common), NC (normally closed); rated for DC 30V/10A.
- **Features**: Opto-isolated input, mechanical relay output with status indicators.

#### Wiring with Relays

For each color (red, green, blue), use one relay module:

1. **Power the Relay**:
    - Connect the 24V power supply’s male Dupont connector (+24V to VCC, ground to GND) to each module.
    - On the breadboard, assign one power rail to +24V and another to ground. Use jumper wires to connect +24V and ground to each module’s VCC and GND pins.
2. **Trigger Signal**:
    - Set the jumper to “High Level Trigger” (NO connects to COM when IN is 5V).
    - Connect Arduino pin 9 to the IN pin of the red relay, pin 10 to green, pin 11 to blue, using jumper wires via the breadboard.
3. **LED Connection**:
    - Connect the 24V power supply’s +24V to the COM pin of each relay.
    - Connect the NO pin of each relay to the corresponding color wire (red, green, blue) of the LED’s female Dupont connector via jumper wires.
    - Connect the white wire directly to the ground rail.
4. **Grounding**:
    - Ensure the Arduino’s ground is connected to the breadboard’s ground rail, making it common with the 24V supply and LED ground.

#### Breadboard Layout (830-Point: 63 Rows, Dual Power Rails per Side)

- **Power Rails**: Left +24V rail (from 24V supply), left ground rail (common ground).
- **Red Relay**:
    - VCC to +24V rail, GND to ground rail (e.g., row 1).
    - IN to Arduino pin 9 via a jumper (e.g., row 2).
    - COM to +24V rail, NO to red wire (e.g., row 3).
- **Green Relay**: Similar, shifted down (e.g., rows 5-7), IN to pin 10, NO to green wire.
- **Blue Relay**: Rows 9-11, IN to pin 11, NO to blue wire.
- **LED Connector**: White wire to ground rail, color wires to respective NO pins via jumpers.

#### Limitations

- **No PWM Dimming**: Mechanical relays can’t switch at PWM frequencies (e.g., 490 Hz on Arduino pins 9-11) due to their slow response (typically 5-10ms). They’re suited for on/off control, not dimming.
- **Code Compatibility**: The code’s analogWrite() calls (0-255) would effectively act as binary switches (0 = off, >0 = on), losing the dimming feature (modes 0 and 1 would be full brightness or off).

**Conclusion**: Relays work for basic on/off control but don’t support PWM dimming, making them incompatible with the code’s intent.

### Option 2: PWM-Compatible Circuit with MOSFETs

To preserve PWM dimming, we need a circuit that switches 24V using 5V PWM signals. Since the LEDs are common-cathode, we require **high-side switching** (controlling the anode side at +24V). P-channel MOSFETs, controlled by NPN transistors, are a practical solution.

#### Circuit Design

For each color:

- **P-channel MOSFET**: Switches 24V to the LED anode.
- **NPN Transistor**: Controls the MOSFET gate using the Arduino’s 5V PWM signal.
- **Resistors**: Limit currents and define logic states.

#### Components (Per Color)

- **P-channel MOSFET**: E.g., BSS84 (Vds = -50V, Id = -130mA), sufficient for LED currents (assumed <100mA).
- **NPN Transistor**: E.g., 2N3904 (Ic = 200mA, Vce = 40V).
- **Resistors**:
    - 10kΩ: Pulls MOSFET gate to +24V (off state).
    - 1kΩ: Limits base current to NPN transistor.

#### Circuit Operation

- **MOSFET**: Source to +24V, drain to LED anode (color wire), gate controlled.
- **NPN**: Collector to MOSFET gate, emitter to ground, base to Arduino PWM pin via 1kΩ.
- **Pull-up**: 10kΩ from MOSFET gate to +24V.
- **Logic**:
    - Arduino HIGH (5V): NPN on, gate to ground, MOSFET on, LED lights.
    - Arduino LOW (0V): NPN off, gate to +24V, MOSFET off, LED off.
    - PWM: Duty cycle modulates LED brightness.

#### Breadboard Wiring

- **Power Rails**: Left +24V rail, left ground rail from 24V supply.
- **Red Channel** (e.g., rows 1-5):
    - MOSFET: Source to +24V rail (row 1A), drain to red wire (row 1E), gate to row 2A.
    - NPN: Collector to row 2A, emitter to ground rail (row 2J), base to row 3A.
    - 10kΩ: Row 2A to +24V rail.
    - 1kΩ: Row 3A to Arduino pin 9 via jumper.
- **Green Channel**: Rows 6-10, drain to green wire, base via 1kΩ to pin 10.
- **Blue Channel**: Rows 11-15, drain to blue wire, base via 1kΩ to pin 11.
- **LED Connector**: White wire to ground rail, color wires to respective drains.
- **Grounding**: Arduino ground to breadboard ground rail.

#### Component List (Total)

- 3x P-channel MOSFETs (e.g., BSS84).
- 3x NPN transistors (e.g., 2N3904).
- 3x 10kΩ resistors.
- 3x 1kΩ resistors.
- Jumper wires (from kit).

### PWM Compatibility with MakerBot LEDs

The MightyBoard likely used PWM for dimming, as it’s standard for RGB LED control in 3D printers (e.g., status indicators). The LEDs and their circuitry should handle PWM frequencies (Arduino default: 490 Hz), as this is within typical LED tolerances. The MOSFET circuit mimics this behavior, delivering 0-24V average voltage based on duty cycle, matching the code’s scaling (ledMaxLevel = 128 limits brightness to 50%, adjustable to 255 for full range).

---

### Final Recommendation

- **Relays**: Use for simple on/off control if dimming isn’t needed, but they don’t support the code’s PWM functionality.
- **MOSFETs**: Preferred for full compatibility, enabling dimming as intended. Wire as described on the 830-point breadboard using the MOSFET circuit. No additional power supply beyond the 24V output is required, and the setup uses common components.

This MOSFET-based solution ensures your code’s updateLED() function works as designed, controlling the MakerBot Replicator 2X LEDs with the same dimming and color-mixing capabilities originally prototyped with the Elegoo RGB module.
