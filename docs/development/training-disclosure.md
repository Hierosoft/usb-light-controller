## usb-light-controller.ino, training-generated.md
I have an arduino UNO R3 board and I want to make a USB light controller with a speaker. I am not sure if the piezo tweeter can be manipulated to make different pitches, but let's see how close we can get. I have an Elegoo 37 Sensor kit as well. I want to use the 4-lead RGB light (regular not SMD), 3-lead button, and 3-lead piezo tweeter. Is there any way to plug them directly into the board without wires? As in, can we make a program and can you explain what headers to plug them into? I want the UNO to be able to receive and process a RGB signal over USB, that is a string-encoded hex packet similar to model railroad GridConnect, but like: ":48010A0003FFFFFF;" . Whenever our buffer has both ":" and ";" process the packet (send the data between ":" and ";" to a processing function). What it should be able to do so far is utilize the RGB light, button, and speaker. Explain wiring necessary if there aren't easy "3 in a row" or "4 in a row" pin sets, but prefer directly plugging the components into the UNO headers when possible. In this example, "4801" is the protocol specification (Hex for "H" 01 being version 1), so if that is not at the start of the packet, set error level to 1. In this example, 0A is the payload size (10 not including ";"), so if there are fewer hex characters than that, set error level to 3, and if there are more than that set error level to 4. Always stop processing in the packet processing function when an error level is set. Do not reset error level to 0 except during power on. In this protocol version, the next two hex pairs are the command. Parse them as big endian hex, so 0003 is command 3. If a command number is encountered that is not implemented, set error level to 2. Command 3 is set light color. In this example, the color is FFFFFF, RGB encoded as hex. If command is 3, parse the 3 hex pairs and set red green and blue decimal (byte) variables. The error level is utilized in the loop as follows: flash the builtin light for 250 ms, off 250 ms, then delay 3 seconds and repeat, similar to this example but extending it as I've specified: ```void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)```. If the error level is 1, loop 1 time for 250 ms, off 250 ms before the 3 second delay. If the error level is more than one, repeat the 250ms on and off that many times, then do the 3 second delay once as usual, and repeat this entire process on each loop call until error level changes (if -1, do nothing, and if 0 turn light off. After turning the light off, set error level to -1 to ensure that the digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW); command doesn't run all the time). If the command is 1, that is the beep command. In that case, it is followed by 4 hex pairs: The first two pairs are a USHORT16 big endian for frequency in Hz, USHORT16 big endian duration in milliseconds. There are 3 possible states for the LED light: last color, white, and off. The last color is whatever the last color packet set the light to (if not set, red by default). When the button is pressed, the LED mode cycles between last color, white, and off, and each time the button is pressed the frequency of a C note plays for 100ms unless it is "last color" in which case the frequency of A440 plays (The C should be the C just above A440).
